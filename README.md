# PN7150
Library/Driver for NXP PN7150 NFC device

All documentation is in the Repository Wiki : https://github.com/Strooom/PN7150/wiki

I need help : the NFC-Forum specifications are only free of charge for members. In order to improve and extend this driver, I need more and more recent specs. Please contact me if you are willing to share a copy with me. Thanks!
